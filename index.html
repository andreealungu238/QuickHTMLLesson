    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>HTML is a markup language that uses a special syntax or notation to describe the structure of a webpage to the browser.
         HTML elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content. 
         For example, different elements can describe text as a heading, paragraph, or list item.

    <h3>HTML Elements</h3>
    <p>Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag. All img elements must have an alt attribute. The text inside an alt attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility 
        and is displayed if the image fails to load. In order to link an content outside of the web page, an <i>a</i> (anchor) element is used. <i>a</i> elements need a destination web address called an href attribute. 
         They also need anchor text. <a href="https://digital.com/tools/html-cheatsheet/">Here</a> is a cool cheat sheet explaining all the HTML elements.</p>
